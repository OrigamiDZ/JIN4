# JIN4

Project realised in two weeks in order to test us on the C++ course we were introduced to.
This game is based on SFML and Photon Engine.

The game is based on the 9 muses of the greek mythologie, each having a cultural subject. 
The player have to answer to cultural questions, on the subects of the 9 muses. 
The player can play solo or against an opponant.   

Unfortunetly, the architecture of this game wasn't adapted for a multiplayer usage.
The game was redone, see the JIN4-Bis repesotary
